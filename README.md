##Project Intro
This project is an open sourced classified ad system with user management and content list capabilities.

##Helpful Info
By default the Global.asax file registers a custom "DatabaseBetaTestInitializer" which initializes the database with test data.
After initialization it may be good to comment out this line of code since it deletes and rebuilds the DB each time the application is initialized.
