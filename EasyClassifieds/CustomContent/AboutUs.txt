<p>With the percentage of online shopping in America increasing year after year the purpose and mission of PawnPosts.com is to expand the pawn broker industry into the rapidly growing world of online shopping and e-commerce. PawnPosts.com is a company devoted solely to pawn shops, with a business plan to provide them with a method of reaching out to this constantly growing market. </p>

<p>On the site, pawn shops will have the ability to list hundreds of items that they have for sale inside their store, that previously have only been seen by visitors of the store itself. Now customers can see these items from the convenience of their own home or office, and have the ability to locate a particular item inside a pawn shop whether it is locally or in a different city.</p>

<p>PawnPosts.com is in the beginning stages as a company and a website, and over the next few weeks and months there will be many changes and additions to the site itself, in order to better serve the customers and businesses. With that, any requests and/or ideas anyone may have will be taken into consideration and greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting PawnPosts.com!</p>
